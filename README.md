#  Registration Form(EMP)

This project is on the Employee registration form
Here I am storing the data in the API(db.json),
And by using the API I am doing the crud operation
in this app.
This app is also responsive because I have used
Material UI to create this app.



## Tools Required
● VS code

● Material UI
(ToolBar,ContactMailIcon,Radio,Dialog,etc..)

● React

● React Spinners(PropagateLoader)

● Node Package Manager

● Axios(Get,Post,Put,Delete)

● Windows OS
## Setup
● Create the Root Folder

● Install react and react-dom

● Install packages

● Index.html is the regular HTML. We are setting
div id=”app.js” as a root element for our app.
App.js This is the first react component this
component will render our project.js file which is
the other component.

● For running the server we have to enter the app
folder

● We can start the server by running the command
(npm start)in the terminal which runs our code in
the localhost:3000

● In this project, I made an additional db.json file in
which I am storing the data in an array of objects
format and by using that data only I am doing the
CRUD operation like adding employees, editing,
delete

● For getting the photo from the local device I just
converted the given URL into base64 format and
used this format only to display the photo in
frontend

● These are the necessary packages that I installed
while working on this project.
project.(like node package,MUI,MUI
Icons,reactSpinners)

● npx create-react-app my-app(creating new app
my-app)

● npm install -g npm(install node globally)

● npm i react-spinners

● npm i axios

● npm install @mui/material @emotion/react
@emotion/styled

● npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc
styled-components

● npm i @mui/icons-material

● npm i eslint

● And also I have installed the eslint packages,
which make my code more consistent and avoid
bugs

## Features
● My application is fully responsive which means it
can be adjusted with any devices

● I have created all the necessary operations for
creating a form in this project

● We collect name, email, qualification details,
gender, and profile picture from the user in this
project

● In order to add a new employee first click the ADD
EMPLOYEE button.

● The user is presented with a dialog form where the
details can be filled in and submitted.

● The alert box will tell the user to fill out all the
details if he or she is unable to provide any of the
details

● Furthermore, if the user enters an email address
that is already in the API, an alert will appear that
the email address is already in the API

● A table will be created with the data

● When the page loads for the first time or the user
adds, deletes, or edits an employee, the
PropagateLoader will execute, making the app
more user-friendly.

● The operation column has an edit button that users
can click on if they want to edit the data

● When the edit operation is completed the
“Propagateloader ”will activate and after that alert,
the box will arrive for the confirmation that the edit
operation is completed successfully.

● We can come out of the form by clicking the cancel
button


## Learning
● Learn how to get the data from the JSON server.

● How to implement Regular Expression in various
fields?

● Various hooks (useState,useEffect,useRef)

● Storing the data in objects form in the db.json file

● Most importantly how to convert the local path to
base64 and display that image in our app.

● Ternary operator usage Pattern.

● Material UI Components
(Grid,TabelCell,TableBody,Dialog,Icons ).

● Inline CSS in Material UI.

● CRUD functionality

● React-Spinners packages
